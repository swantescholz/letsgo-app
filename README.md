# letsgo-app
An app to play classical board games, making moves based on your GPS-coordinates, against an AlphaZero-like AI.

This game is unfinished. While a basic, MCTS-based AI is already functional, a stronger AlphaZero-like AI still needs to be created/trained via Tensorflow (which will happen in a separate Python project).
